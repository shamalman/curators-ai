# CLAUDE.md — Curators.AI Engineering Guide
## Last updated: April 17, 2026 (nav rework: Find tab, Me default → My Recs)

---

## Mission

Preserve, access, and amplify human curation. Build equally for curators (capture, share, earn from taste) and subscribers (find trusted curators, discover great recs).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS + PostgREST)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API. SDK 0.80.0. Model ID pinned in `app/api/chat/route.js`: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **Hosting:** Vercel, auto-deploys from GitHub main (~60s)
- **Email:** Resend
- **Styling:** Inline styles only, no Tailwind
- **Markdown rendering:** `react-markdown` v10, no GFM plugin (plain CommonMark only)
- **No local dev environment.** All changes deploy directly to production via GitHub → Vercel.

---

## Vocabulary (enforce everywhere: code, prompts, UI, comments)

- "subscribe" not "follow"
- "curator" not "user" or "creator"
- "taste" not "preferences"
- "recommendations" or "recs" not "content" or "posts"
- "Personal Record" is the user-facing label for the Taste File on /me. Internal references (DB, code, skill files, "taste" as a concept) stay as "taste."
- "Lens" is the user-facing label for the MyAI tab and AI surface. Internal references (route /myai, component names, log markers, prompt content) stay unchanged. The AI does not yet refer to itself as "Lens."

---

## Key Development Rules

1. **Read files before editing.** Always `cat` current state first.
2. **No silent catch {}.** Always surface errors explicitly.
3. **No Supabase join aliases.** Use two-step queries instead.
4. **After new DB columns/tables:** run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'` in Supabase SQL Editor. PostgREST silently drops unknown columns without this.
5. **No em dashes** in AI skill files, prompt text, or AI output.
6. **Verify column existence** before writing queries against unfamiliar tables.
7. **Add RLS policies** for new write operations.
8. **Deploy one change at a time.** Each deploy independently testable on iPhone Safari.
9. **Descriptive commit messages.**
10. **Hard refresh Safari** after deploys.

---

## Data patterns

**Handle comparison — always normalize:** `profiles.handle` values are stored in the DB without a `@` prefix (e.g. `shamal`, not `@shamal`). However, the client-side `profile.handle` value consumed via `useCurator()` may appear with a `@` prefix due to display-layer formatting somewhere in the profile load path. You cannot trust which form you're holding without inspecting the source.

Because of this ambiguity, NEVER compare handles directly. Always use `normalizeHandle()` from `lib/handles.js`, which strips any leading `@` and lowercases:

    import { normalizeHandle } from '@/lib/handles';
    if (normalizeHandle(profile.handle) === 'shamal') { ... }

This rule applies to ALL handle comparisons — client code, server routes, DB filters, and allowlists. Failing to normalize caused the silent-toggle bug (fixed 2026-04-19) and a broken admin-transcripts allowlist (fixed 2026-04-19).

**TODO (deferred):** audit where the client prepends `@` to profile handles and decide whether to normalize at the source. Tracked for post-alpha cleanup.

---

## Architecture

### App Shell / Navigation

Four main tabs, left to right: Lens (/myai), Me (/me), Find (/find), Subs (/subs).
Shamal-only: Feedback (/admin/feedback) appended.

Nav components:
- `components/layout/BottomTabs.jsx` — mobile bottom bar
- `components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — desktop sidebar
- Icons are Unicode glyphs (◈ Lens, ▢ Me, ⌖ Find, ♡ Subs)

Me tab structure (3-button segmented control in `components/me/MeSegmentedControl.jsx`):
- `/me` → My Recs (default, renders `TasteManager embedded`)
- `/me/taste` → Personal Record (renders `TasteFileView`)
- `/{handle}` → Public Profile (renders `VisitorProfile` for owner)

`/me/timeline` falls through the layout pathname check and keeps the Personal Record segment active — the "How this was built →" link lives inside Personal Record.

Find tab structure (segmented control in `app/(curator)/find/page.js`):
- Curators Network (default) — `NetworkView`
- Saved — `SavedView`

Route history: `/recommendations` was renamed to `/find` on 2026-04-17. The `/recommendations` → `/find` redirect is handled solely by `next.config.js` as a permanent redirect. Middleware no longer references any `curatorOnlyPaths` array — that logic was removed in the April 19, 2026 auth lockdown (see Auth Model section). All internal `router.push('/recommendations/...')` and `router.push('/recommendations/<slug>')` calls were updated to `/find/...` in the rename commit.

### Rec Storage

Two tables — parent/child, both active:
- `recommendations` — flat queryable metadata (title, slug, category, tags, context, links, visibility, profile_id, rec_file_id)
- `rec_files` — canonical structured content blocks (body_md, work, curation, source, provenance, extraction, visibility). See `docs/rec-files-migration.md`.

**`recommendations.created_via`** (analytics-only, not UI) tags each save with its origin — `quick_capture_url|paste|upload`, `chat_rec_block`, `chat_save_from_url|image|taste_read`, `backfill`, or `unknown`. Populated in `addRec` from `item.createdVia`; QCS reads `initialData.createdViaOverride` to distinguish chat-originated saves from direct QCS tab saves.

**`recommendations.image_url` + `rec_files.work.image_url`** — data-layer capture of a thumbnail URL per rec. Populated on every new save (shipped 2026-04-15; no backfill, no UI consumer). Source: parser's `metadata.thumbnailUrl` normalized onto the `parsedPayload.image_url` envelope at each of 6 constructors (parse-link / paste / upload / QCS / CuratorContext re-parse / ChatView chat-parse); upload mode writes `artifact://<sha256>`. Read via `extractImageUrl(parsedPayload)` in `lib/agent/parsers/extract-image.js`.

**Dual-write is unconditional.** Every URL/paste/upload save writes to both tables. Gate: `if (item.parsedPayload)` in `addRec` (CuratorContext.jsx ~line 310). Failures logged, never thrown. All 30 production rows have `rec_file_id` populated as of 2026-04-11.

**Capture flow:** `parse-link / paste / upload` route → `parsedPayload` envelope → client → `addRec` → `recommendations` insert → `ingestUrlCapture` → `rec_files` insert → `recommendations.rec_file_id` update.

**buildRecFileRow** (`lib/rec-files/build.js`) is the single source of truth for the `rec_files` row shape.

**Feature B (chat image → rec):** Camera in ChatView → `/api/chat` vision inference → `save_image_rec:<sha>` action button → QCS prefill → `/api/recs/upload`. `maxDuration = 60` on both routes. Client-side resize to 1600px / JPEG 0.85 keeps payload under Vercel's 4.5MB serverless body limit. Upload `body_md` is just `![Uploaded image](artifact://<sha>)`; title/why render above Archived Source, not inside it.

**RecDetail section order:** Your Take / Why → MediaEmbed (gated by NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_EMBEDS_ENABLED) → Links → Archived Source (body_md) → Tags. Applies to all three variants (Curator/Visitor/Network).

**Archived Source (RecDetail.jsx):** `ArchivedSource` renders `body_md` as ReactMarkdown in a collapsible block below Links, with client-side .md download. Custom `img` renderer (`ArtifactImage`) resolves `artifact://<sha256>` URLs via Supabase signed URLs (7-day TTL); react-markdown v10's `urlTransform` is overridden to whitelist the `artifact://` protocol. Hidden when `extraction.lossy === true` or the extractor is in `THIN_SOURCE_TYPES` (media embeds whose body_md just restates metadata).

**MediaEmbed (RecDetail.jsx):** Inline iframe player for embeddable source types (YouTube, Spotify track/album/playlist/episode, Apple Music song/album/playlist, SoundCloud). Renders between Why and Links. Click-to-play, no autoplay. Returns null for non-embeddable sources, missing media IDs, or when `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_EMBEDS_ENABLED !== 'true'`. Extractor matching strips `@registry`/`@v1` suffix and normalizes hyphens to underscores (so `apple_music@registry` matches). Source URL read from `links[0].url`. Helper: `lib/recs/embed-url.js` (`deriveEmbedUrl`). Sandboxed and lazy-loaded.

**Curator + Visitor context secondary load** merges `body_md`, `extraction`, `work`, `curation_block`, `curator_is_author` from rec_files onto each tasteItem after the recommendations fetch. Null-safe. Both `CuratorContext` and `VisitorContext` use the same pattern. Both also map `profile_id` onto each tasteItem so rec detail components can pass the rec owner's UUID to `ArtifactImage` (required for signed URL path construction).

`updateRec` syncs `rec_files.curation` (why, tags) and `rec_files.work` (title, category) after every edit. Logs `[UPDATE_REC_FILE]` on success, `[UPDATE_REC_FILE_ERROR]` on failure. Added April 13 2026.

### Chat Route (app/api/chat/route.js)

**Modes:** Onboarding (< 3 recs OR no bio) | Standard (3+ recs AND bio) | Visitor (another curator's /ask page).

Both onboarding and standard inject `getSubscribedRecs(profileId)` network context into the system prompt.

**Link handling:** Synchronous. Up to 3 URLs parsed concurrently (15s timeout) before Claude responds. Quality signals (FULL/PARTIAL/FAILED) injected as `=== PARSED LINK CONTENT ===` blocks. Parsed content persisted on `chat_messages.parsed_content` and re-injected within a 5-message window via `distillForReinjection` (~800 chars/block, capped at 2 blocks). **Re-injection path:** Checks `rec_refs` on recent messages -- if present, fetches `rec_files` rows and injects structured blocks via `buildRecFileContextBlock` (`lib/chat/link-parsing.js`). No fallback to `parsed_content` -- if `rec_refs` is empty, re-injection is skipped. The `parsed_content` fallback was removed April 13 2026.

**Taste-read re-injection cap:** `parsed.content` capped at 40K chars before injection into systemPrompt (matches primary parse path). Uses `truncateOnBoundary` (`lib/chat/link-parsing.js`) for paragraph/sentence/line-aware cutting; emits `[TASTE_READ_REINJECTION] Capped content from <original> to <capped> chars` when truncation fires. 40K retained as-is — taste-read is the deep-reading moment and a smaller cap would truncate substantive article content mid-piece. Boundary-aware upgrade and log marker added April 15 2026.

**Chat-parsed URLs:** `ingestChatParsedBlocks` (`lib/chat/chat-parse-ingest.js`) writes a `rec_files` row (`extractor: chat-parse@v1`, `visibility: private`, `confirmed: false`) and populates `chat_messages.rec_refs` for each successfully parsed URL. Awaited with 2s timeout before response returns. These rows are ephemeral scratch records -- they exist for re-injection context, not as canonical archive entries.

**Chat-save promotion flow:** When a curator saves a `chat-parse@v1` URL, `addRec` synchronously re-fetches via `/api/recs/parse-link` for a fresh `webpage@registry` payload, then `/api/recs/promote-chat-parse` marks the scratch row confirmed, then `ingestUrlCapture` writes the canonical `rec_files` row. `recommendations.rec_file_id` always points to the registry row. Re-parse failure falls back to the chat-parse payload. **Re-parse logic lives in `addRec` only** — no other UI surface should re-parse.

**draftWhyFromConversation** (ChatView.jsx) extracts the curator's own words from recent chat history to prefill the "why" field. Skips URL-only messages (`/^https?:\/\/\S+$/`), messages shorter than 15 chars after URL removal, and meta-actions (save/skip buttons). Truncates at 200 chars on a word boundary.

**Rec capture:** AI emits `[REC]{...}[/REC]` JSON. `validateRecContext` strips metadata pollution, falls back to last substantive user message (skips pure affirmations).

**Action Buttons emitted by chat route.** The chat route emits structured `action_buttons` blocks that ChatView intercepts via onSendMessage. Current action strings in production:

- `save_rec_from_chat:<url>` — "Add as recommendation" button on URL drops. Opens QuickCaptureSheet prefilled with the URL. Part of the three-option URL-drop block (see below).
- `taste_read:<url>` — "Taste read" button on URL drops. Client intercept sends "Do a taste read on <url>" to chat, triggering the `tasteReadUrl` short-circuit at `app/api/chat/route.js:232` which emits a TasteReadCard block. Synchronous, uses in-process parsers.
- `discuss_link:<url>` — "Just talk about it" button on URL drops. Silent meta-action, logs choice to `dropped_links` via `/api/dropped-links/mark-action`, does not send anything to the chat route.
- `save_image_rec:<sha256>` — Feature B chat-image-to-rec flow. Intercepted in ChatView, opens QuickCaptureSheet in upload mode with pre-uploaded artifact.
- `save_rec_from_taste_read:<url>` — Button on TasteReadCard footer. Opens QuickCaptureSheet with blank why (taste read context is not curator's why).

**Three-option URL-drop block.** Emitted unconditionally on ANY URL drop (including failed parses), subject to three suppression conditions:
1. The URL actually produced a parsedLinkBlock entry (even failed parses push a block)
2. No `[REC]...[/REC]` block was also emitted in the same turn (`!recCapture` guard)
3. The current message is not itself a follow-on triggered by one of these buttons (`!isFollowOnFromButtons` guard, at `app/api/chat/route.js:837`, prevents button loops)

**REC_LINK sentinel:** Rec lines in network context carry `[REC_LINK: /<handle>/<slug>]`. Prompt instructs AI to render as markdown links. Canonical rec URL: `/{handle}/{slug}`.

**Tool use (Anthropic):** `get_curator_stats` registers only when `!isVisitor && !isOnboarding && !!profileId` via a one-hop loop around the primary `messages.create`. Definition + handler: `lib/chat/stats-tool.js`. Compute + per-lambda 10-min cache: `lib/chat/curator-stats.js`. Skill: `lib/prompts/skills/curator-stats.md`. Text extraction uses `response.content.find(b => b.type === 'text')?.text` — do NOT revert to `content[0].text`; on tool-use turns the first block is `tool_use` and that path silently drops the reply. Sets the convention for future Anthropic tools in this route: curator-only gate, one-hop loop, handler returns `{success, stats}` or `{success, error}`.

### AI Skills System

15 skill files in `lib/prompts/skills/`. Build functions: `buildOnboardingPrompt` and `buildStandardPrompt` in `lib/prompts/`. Both append `SUBSCRIPTION_GROUNDING_RULE` (must stay in sync between the two files).

**rec-capture.md skill:** Save threshold evaluation is cumulative across the conversation. Once a descriptor is given in any message, threshold is met -- no further clarifying questions permitted. AI-005 (`docs/ai-behavior-issues.md`) tracks the multi-question drilling failure mode.

### Taste Profile Pipeline

Generated by `lib/taste-profile/generate.js` via `POST /api/generate-taste-profile`. Auto-regenerates after every rec save (3+ rec threshold, fire-and-forget from ChatView.jsx). Enriched from `rec_files` — prefers `work.title`, `work.authors`, `work.site_name`, `curation.why`, `curation.tags`, `curation.conviction` over legacy `recommendations` columns. `sources.generated_from` = `'rec_files+recommendations+subscriptions+confirmations'`. Stats section includes a "N taste signals confirmed or corrected" bullet. `taste_profiles.sources` breaks out `taste_read_confirmed_count` and `taste_read_corrected_count` from the total `confirmation_count`.

**Visitor AI personality** reads `taste_profiles.content`. `lib/taste-profile/parse.js` exposes `extractPublicSections(content)` (strips `## Curators They Subscribe To` onward) and `extractVoiceAndStyle(content)` (the `## Voice & Style` body). Visitor path in `app/api/chat/route.js` injects public sections as taste context and Voice & Style as a voice directive; falls back to a neutral default when no profile exists. The legacy `profiles.style_summary` column was deprecated on 2026-04-15 (readers/writers removed) and dropped on 2026-04-16 via `migrations/20260415_drop_style_summary_from_profiles.sql`.

### Taste Read v2 (shipped April 14, 2026 across deploys 2.0-2.4)

**What it is:** Per-URL taste reads that produce structured extraction + 2-3 atomic inferences. Curator confirms, refines, or ignores each inference. Confirmed/refined inferences feed the taste profile via `taste_confirmations`. Ignored inferences are logged only.

**Key files:**
- `lib/prompts/skills/taste-read.md` — the skill. Outputs JSON `{extraction, inferences: [{id, text}]}`.
- `app/api/taste-read/route.js` — GET (hydrate from DB) + POST (generate or cache hit). Model pinned to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, max_tokens 1500, temp 0.7, maxDuration 30.
- `app/api/taste-read/confirm/route.js` — POST (write) + DELETE (undo).
- `app/api/taste-read/refine/route.js` — POST (write) + DELETE (undo).
- `app/api/taste-read/ignore/route.js` — POST (write) + DELETE (undo).
- `app/api/taste-read/state/route.js` — PATCH for UI state sync (states, refined_texts, collapsed, dismissed, done).
- `components/taste-read/TasteReadCard.jsx` — card component. Module-level cache is render-speed only; server is authoritative.
- `components/feed/FeedBlockGroup.jsx` — renders `taste_read_card` block type.

**Database:**
- `taste_reads` — new table. Stores extraction, inferences (jsonb), per-inference states, refined_texts, collapsed, dismissed, done. Partial unique indexes on `(profile_id, source_url) WHERE rec_file_id IS NULL` and `(profile_id, rec_file_id) WHERE rec_file_id IS NOT NULL`. RLS enabled.
- `taste_read_ignores` — new table. Ignored inferences log, curator-only.
- `taste_confirmations` — existing. New source format: `taste_read:<url_or_rec_file_id>` and `taste_read:<key>|refined_from:<original>`. Legacy `chat:<msgId>` rows from pre-v2 left as-is (both formats supported).

**Flow:** Curator pastes URL in chat → taps "Taste read" button → chat route emits `taste_read_card` block with parsed content payload → TasteReadCard on mount checks in-memory cache → GET `/api/taste-read` → 404 triggers POST (Claude call + INSERT) → card renders extraction + inferences. State transitions PATCH fire-and-forget to `/api/taste-read/state` for UI state sync. Confirm/refine/ignore POST to their dedicated endpoints (which write to `taste_confirmations` / `taste_read_ignores` and trigger taste profile regen).

**Done state semantics:** When all inferences resolved, "Done" button appears. Clicking Done sets `done: true, collapsed: true`. Reload hydrates from DB in collapsed summary state. Tap-to-expand shows finalized view (Undo links active, no Confirm/Refine/Ignore buttons). Any Undo from done state flips `done: false` server-side — card becomes live again.

**Dismiss state:** Sticky via DB. Dismissed cards render null on mount. Only available when no inferences are resolved.

**Action buttons:**
- `save_rec_from_taste_read:<url>` — from TasteReadCard footer. ChatView handler routes to `handleSaveFromChat(url, { skipWhyDraft: true })` — QCS opens with blank why field (taste read context is not the curator's why).
- `save_rec_from_chat:<url>` — from pre-taste-read three-button row. Unchanged from Feature C.

**What's NOT wired yet:**
- QuickCaptureSheet integration (TasteReadCard rendering after URL/paste save). Deferred per Option Y (portal/modal at page level after QCS closes).

**Log markers:** `[TASTE_READ_V2]` (main read), `[TASTE_READ_CONFIRM]` / `[TASTE_READ_REFINE]` / `[TASTE_READ_IGNORE]` (writes), `[TASTE_READ_CONFIRM_UNDO]` / `[TASTE_READ_REFINE_UNDO]` / `[TASTE_READ_IGNORE_UNDO]` (deletes), `[TASTE_READ_STATE_PATCH]` (UI state sync).

### Taste Timeline (shipped April 14, 2026)

Curator-only audit trail at `/me/timeline`. Shows every signal that shaped the taste profile in reverse chronological order, grouped by local date. Entry point: "How this was built →" link in Me tab below Stats section (`TasteFileView.jsx`).

**Key files:**
- `app/api/timeline/route.js` — GET, cursor-paginated 50/page. Merges taste_confirmations (confirmed + corrected), taste_read_ignores (fetched, filtered from UI), and recommendations. Parses taste_read source field format. Two-step Supabase queries throughout.
- `app/(curator)/me/timeline/page.js` — auth-guarded page. Note .js not .jsx (project convention).
- `components/me/TasteTimeline.jsx` — timeline UI. Uses T constants for theming. Groups by local date. Type labels: "Taste read · confirmed/corrected", "Your Recommendation" (rec_is_own: true), "Saved Recommendation" (rec_is_own: false, deferred).

**Event types:** confirmed (green #1D9E75), corrected (amber #BA7517, shows struck-through original + corrected), ignored (stored in DB, filtered from UI), rec_saved with rec_is_own: true (blue, "Your Recommendation"), rec_is_own: false (purple, "Saved Recommendation" — deferred until saved_recs wired).

**Log markers:** [TIMELINE], [TIMELINE_ERROR]

### Inviter Pipe & Auto-subscribe

`getInviterContext` in `lib/chat/inviter-context.js` — three independent `.maybeSingle()` lookups so one failure doesn't wipe the rest. Auto-subscribe route: `app/api/onboarding/auto-subscribe/route.js` — service-role, idempotent, race-safe (treats `23505` as success), non-blocking.

---

## Auth Model

Site-wide auth lockdown shipped April 19, 2026. Chokepoint is `middleware.js`. Policy:

**Public routes (no auth required):**
- `/login`, `/signup`, `/onboarding`, `/onboarding/welcome`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`
- `/email/saved`, `/email/unsubscribed` (email action landing pages)
- `/` — unauthed splash/waitlist. Authed users redirect to `/myai`.

**Public API routes (no auth required, enforced in middleware):**
- `/api/auth/callback`, `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/waitlist`, `/api/email-action`

**All other `/api/*` routes:** middleware passes through without session check. Each route handler enforces its own auth. This pattern lets routes like `/api/notify/*` do session + ownership checks internally while letting cron/token-authed routes like `/api/email-action` continue to work.

**All other routes:** require authed session. Unauthed requests redirect to `/login?redirectTo=<encoded-original-path-with-querystring>`.

**`redirectTo` open-redirect protection** (in `app/login/page.js`): after sign-in, the redirectTo param is validated before use:
- Must start with `/`
- Must NOT start with `//` or `/\` (prevent protocol-relative and backslash tricks)
- Must NOT be `/login` or `/signup` (prevent loops)
- If unsafe or absent, fall back to `/myai`
- Onboarding-incomplete always forces `/onboarding` regardless of redirectTo

**SEO lockdown:** `app/layout.js` metadata includes `robots: { index: false, follow: false, googleBot: { index: false, follow: false } }`. `app/robots.js` serves `User-Agent: *\nDisallow: /` to all crawlers.

---

## Admin Access Model

Two admin surfaces exist, with different access policies:

- **`/admin/feedback`** — Shamal-only. Client-side handle check gates rendering.
- **`/admin/transcripts`** — Full access for BOTH `shamal` and `chris` (no per-curator scoping). Previously `chris` was restricted to own-transcripts; restriction removed April 19, 2026 per founder decision (CK is a collaborator on AI personality, not just a tester). Server-side allowlist enforced in `app/api/admin/transcripts/route.js`: both handles must normalize via `normalizeHandle()` to either `shamal` or `chris` or the route returns 403.

Both admin pages perform handle normalization via `lib/handles.js` — do not add new admin pages that compare handles without the helper.

---

## What's Not Wired Yet

- `buildSubscriberPrompt`: skill file exists, no build function or route wiring
- Visitor prompt not extracted to skill system
- AI web search for link lookup
- Taste Read v2: QuickCaptureSheet integration deferred (Option Y, portal/modal at page level after QCS closes)
- Taste Timeline: ignored events stored in DB but not shown in UI — future consideration
- Taste Timeline: Saved Recommendation type (rec_is_own: false) — deferred until saved_recs table is wired into timeline API

---

## Email Notification System

**Subscriber notifications (Phase 1):** Real-time email to active account-holder subscribers when a curator saves a public+approved rec. Fire-and-forget from `addRec` → `POST /api/notify/new-rec`, never blocks the save. Trigger gate reads the DB-returned row (not the client object). Recipients: `subscriptions` where `unsubscribed_at IS NULL` and `profiles.new_rec_email_enabled = true`; email looked up via `supabase.auth.admin.getUserById(auth_user_id)`. Unsubscribe is token-based (`generateEmailToken(... 'unsubscribe', { type: 'new_rec_email' })`) and flips `profiles.new_rec_email_enabled`. Logged as `notification_log` rows with `type='new_rec_realtime'`.

Pure email subscribers (`subscribers` table) and rich content (authors/thumbnails/excerpts) deferred.

Key files: `app/api/notify/new-rec/route.js`, `lib/email-templates.js` (`newRecEmail`), `app/api/email-action/route.js` (`new_rec_email` branch).

**Auth and ownership (added April 19, 2026).** Both `/api/notify/new-rec` and `/api/notify/new-subscriber` now require an authed Supabase session AND an ownership check:
- Session check via `createServerClient` + `getSession()` — returns 401 if no session
- Ownership check: caller's `profiles.id` (looked up via `auth_user_id = session.user.id`) must match the `curatorId` (for new-rec) or `subscriberId` (for new-subscriber) from the request body. Returns 403 on mismatch.
- Since both callers are client-side (CuratorContext and VisitorProfile), the authed browser session cookie rides along automatically on fetch — no header manipulation needed.

**Silent save flag (added April 19, 2026).** `/api/notify/new-rec` accepts an optional `silent: true` in the POST body. When present, the route early-returns `{ skipped: true, reason: 'silent' }` with a `[NOTIFY_SKIPPED]` log line before any email logic runs. The rec still saves and still appears in subscriber feeds — only suppresses the instant email alert. Exposed via a curator-opt-in checkbox in QuickCaptureSheet, currently gated to handle `shamal` via `normalizeHandle()` comparison. Toggle resets to OFF on every sheet open (sticky silent was ruled out as a footgun).

---

## Key Log Markers

Primary filters (grep on these when debugging end-to-end flows): `[TASTE_READ_V2]`, `[TIMELINE]`, `[rec-files]`, `[chat-parse-ingest]`, `[taste-profile]`, `[NOTIFY_NEW_REC]`, `[INVITER_CONTEXT]`, `[AUTO_SUBSCRIBE]`, `[UPDATE_REC_FILE]`.

Each area has a matching `_ERROR` / `_FAILED` / `_UNDO` variant — grep the code for the full set when you need it.

Additional markers with specific payloads worth documenting:

- `[NOTIFY_SKIPPED]` — Logged by `/api/notify/new-rec` when `silent: true` is set in body or (historical) when handle was in NOTIFICATION_SKIP_HANDLES (that env var was removed). Payload: `{ recId, curatorId, reason }`.
- `[ADMIN_TRANSCRIPTS_ACCESS]` — Logged by `/api/admin/transcripts` on every authed call. Payload: `{ caller_profile_id, caller_handle, filterDays }`. Use for auditing admin data access.

## Source Parsers (lib/agent/parsers/)

9 parsers: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Letterboxd, Goodreads, Google Maps, Twitter/X, Generic Webpage (Defuddle — universal fallback). Instagram and Bandcamp deferred.

## Tooling

### Supabase MCP (Claude Code only)

Supabase MCP is configured for this project in read-only mode, scoped to the curators-ai project.

- Available in Claude Code sessions only. Not available in claude.ai threads.
- Read-only: all queries execute as a read-only Postgres user. Writes are not possible through MCP.
- Use for pre-implementation recon: confirm column names, function signatures via schema inspection, row counts, and data shapes before writing handoffs.
- Do NOT paste untrusted content (scraped URLs, email bodies, user-submitted text) into sessions with MCP active — prompt injection risk.
- For writes (migrations, backfills, manual fixes): continue using Supabase SQL Editor with explicit statement review. Never relax MCP to read-write.

Example recon queries the MCP can answer directly:
- "List columns on rec_files"
- "Count recs grouped by created_via in the last 30 days"
- "Show me the 5 most recent rows in chat_messages"
